# Marketing Analytics: Analyze business data, get insights and make actions!
In this project we simulated a real scenario and created marketing strategies based on data.\
In particular, we perfomed the following tasks:
1. **RFM analysis**: RFM stands for "recency, frequency, and monetary value". The idea is
to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how
often they've purchased in the past, and how much they've spent
overall. It allows us to target specific clusters of customers with
communications that are much more relevant for their particular
behavior â€“ and thus generate much higher rates of response, plus
increased loyalty and customer lifetime value.
2. **Churn analysis**: Churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of
the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific
period. The purpose of the churn is to predict which customers are most likely to abandon
and allow us to intervene with appropriate retention initiatives
3. **MBA**: Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that is used to uncover purchase patterns in any
retail setting. MBA looks for what combinations of products most frequently occur together
in transactions. These relationships can be used to:
  - increase profitability through cross-selling,
  - recommendations and promotions
  - the placement of items on a menu or in a store.
4. **RFM + MBA**: It could be useful to provide only some clients more interesting offers. For
example, we can offer high-value customer specific offers based on their
personal shopping cart. For this reason, we can integrate RFM and MBA analyses to gain a
comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and preferences, develop a
customer segmentation strategy based on RFM scores and market basket
analysis results to tailor marketing efforts.
We can utilize data-driven insights to optimize pricing strategies, promotional
offers, and product assortment.
5. **Sentiment analysis**: Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to
determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive,
negative, or neutral. Today, we have large volumes of text data
like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media
comments, and reviews.
*Extra*: sentiment analysis with the re-training of a large pre-trained language model
(Electra-small).\\

For each task a domain specific strategy was implemented.
